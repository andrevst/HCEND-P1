# Module 4 Lesson 2 Notes

## Conclusion

In this lesson, we described a number of key features in Calm – Providers, Projects, RBAC, and the Marketplace.

To quickly recap what we discussed:

Providers are cloud service providers, bare-metals, or existing machines that you can use to deploy, monitor, and govern your applications.

Projects specify the roles to associate with their members, networks that project members can use, infrastructure to deploy onto, and (optionally) usage limits on infrastructure resources.

Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) lets you define different roles in an organization and assign permissions accordingly.
And finally, the Marketplace is a common platform for both the publisher and the consumer, and provides you with the ability to provision an application instantly.
In later lessons, we’ll walk through how these capabilities come together to allow you to automate application deployments in Calm, so your users can deploy applications with just a few clicks.
